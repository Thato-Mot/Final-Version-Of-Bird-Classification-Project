## Overview

Bird species are excellent indicators of environmental health, and their classification through vocalisations offers a non-invasive method for biodiversity monitoring. This project explores various machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify bird species from audio recordings. It incorporates feature extraction, augmentation, and model evaluation to achieve accurate classification.

## Methodology

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Resampling and normalisation.
   - Sliding window segmentation for uniform feature extraction.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Generating MFCCs, Mel spectrograms, and Chroma features.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Training traditional ML models and CNNs.
   - Transfer learning using pre-trained VGG-16 for improved accuracy.

4. **Data Augmentation**:
   - Enhancing model generalisation with synthetic samples.

5. **Evaluation**:
   - Models were assessed using metrics like accuracy and F1-Score.
   - A train-test split (70/30) and intra-species validation were used.
